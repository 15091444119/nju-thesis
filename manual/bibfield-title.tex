\subsection{title}\label{subsec:bibfield-title}

|title|字段表示文献的标题。如果该文献是析出文献（即某个专著中的某一章、某一节或某篇文章），
则|title|字段应该是被引用的析出文章或章节的标题；否则，|title|字段应该是被引用的文献的标题。

若被引用的文献的标题有副标题或其他标题，应将其与主标题用冒号隔开。

例如：
\begin{itemize}
\item |title = {Introduction to Algorithm}|
\item |title = {The Art of Computer Programming: Volume 3, Sorting and Searching}|，
\item |title = {马克思恩格斯全集: 第44卷}|
\end{itemize}
