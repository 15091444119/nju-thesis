\subsection{url}\label{subsec:bibfield-url}

|url|字段表示文献的在线URL地址。

如果某文献项有|url|字段，则该文献被认为是在线文献。{\BibTeX}处理后，会在其文献类型后增
加``/OL''，表示其属于在线文献。

如果某文献项有|url|字段，则它也应该有对应的|citedate|字段。

例如：
\begin{itemize}
\item |url = {http://www.di.ens.fr/users/longo/download.html}|
\item |url = {http://www.bjyouth.com.cn/20000412/GB/4216%5ED0412B1401.htm}|
\end{itemize}
